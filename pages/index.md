My name is Jan Stolarek and I am a functional programmer and a compiler engineer
specializing in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/).  I used to work as a
researcher at [Laboratory for Foundations of Computer
Science](https://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/), University of Edinburgh, UK and
[Institute of Information Technology](https://it.p.lodz.pl/), [Łódź University
of Technology](https://p.lodz.pl/), Poland.  I also worked as an architect,
designer, and programmer on several blockchain projects.  For more information
please visit [list of projects I worked on](projects.html), [list of my research
publications](publications.html), and [my blog](blog.html).  My CV is
[here](files/jstolarek-cv.pdf).

Name
====

In Polish, the letter "J" is pronounced like English "Y".  "Jan" is, therefore,
pronounced "Yan" (IPA: [jan]).  However, I usually go by the diminutive "Janek",
which is pronounced "Yanek" (IPA: [ˈjanɛk]).

I also happen to have a second given name that I never use: Wawrzyniec.
Pronunciation is left as an exercise for the reader.
