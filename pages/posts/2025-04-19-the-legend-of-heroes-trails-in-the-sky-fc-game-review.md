The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky FC. Game review
=======================================================

Like most of the Western players, my first experience of a JRPG &mdash; Japanese
Role-Playing Game &mdash; was Final Fantasy VII back in 1997.  Since then, I
have played many JRPG titles, but there are still several long-running series
that I have yet to experience.  One of them is Falcom's *The Legend of Heroes*,
and in particular its *Trails* subseries.  After hearing many recommendations, I
finally decided to give the series a try.

The first entry in *The Legend of Heroes* series appeared in 1989 and to this
day the series has grown to around 20 titles.  I'm not going to walk through
[all of the series'
history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Heroes#History), and will
only note that *Trails* subseries started with *Trails in the Sky FC*[^1] back
in 2004.  Games in the series are grouped into duologies, trilogies, and
tetralogies, such that a single story spans over several games.  Given that all
the *Trails* games are set in the same world and build on top of each other, the
series always seemed very difficult to get into.  I finally decided to bite the
bullet and start with the very first one, the already mentioned *Trails in the
Sky FC*, a first entry in the *Trails in the Sky* trilogy.

The game was originally released back in 2004 for PC and has seen several
re-releases, ports, and revisions since then.  I was considering whether to play
the PSP version or the [PC version from
GOG](https://www.gog.com/pl/game/the_legend_of_heroes_trails_in_the_sky), but
then learned of *Trails in the Sky FC Evolution*, a PS Vita remake with new
artwork and voice acting.  This seemed like the best option to me &mdash; from
experience, I know that playing on a handheld greatly increases the chances of
me finishing a game.  The only catch is that Evolution was not officially
translated into English.  Luckily, there are fan-made patches that apply PC
translation to the Vita version[^2].  Given how this keeps the original Japanese
voice acting, it seems to me like the ultimate version &mdash; at least until I
learn Japanese, so that I can experience the game without any translation.

*Trails in the Sky* &mdash; I refuse to abbreviate the title &mdash; takes place
in Liberl kingdom.  Two main protagonists are Estelle and Joshua Bright, teenage
step-siblings, who aspire to become Bracers.  Bracers are something between a
police force and private detectives &mdash; they fight crime, they fight
monsters, and generally help to keep citizens of Liberl safe.  In their quest to
become Bracers, Estelle and Joshua are sent on a journey across the land to get
to know the kingdom and gain experience by working at the local Bracer Guild
branches.

This setup is unlike most JRPGs.  Although it is not uncommon to play as a
teenager, the stakes in the plot tend to be high.  You either save a friend or
family member, fight to save the kingdom, or even the whole world.  In *Trails
in the Sky*, not so much.  Most of the time, you just help local authorities and
citizens.  At the beginning of the game, there is an incident with pirates
hijacking one of the airships travelling between Liberl's cities, and it does
seem like a beginning of a larger plot, but this quickly fizzles out and does
not really get anywhere until towards the end of the game.  Instead, the player
is fed smaller breadcrumbs throughout the game, hinting there is a major plot
going on.  And indeed there is, but all the threads only converge towards the
end, when all the various incidents encountered along the way are combined into
a coherent, overarching scheme by a master villain and the stakes indeed become
high.  And then the game ends with a massive cliffhanger, which is only
followed-up on in *Trails in the Sky SC*.

Like in other RPGs, there are side quests alongside the main story.  Many are
posted on bulletin boards in each town's Bracer Guild branch, while others are
hidden and available only at a specific place and time.  These optional quests
can be permanently missed if overlooked.

Most of the game mechanics in *Trails in the Sky* are fairly straightforward.
For me, the biggest novelty was the battle system.  Like in many older JRPGs, it
is turn-based, but it includes moving on a grid.  This means that positioning
becomes crucial: melee weapons have a limited range, and effectiveness of area
attacks depends on relative position to the enemy.  Beyond that, the battle
system is fairly standard, with unique character abilities (called Crafts),
magic (called Arts), items etc.  Magical spells are obtained by inserting
magical stones (quartz) into weapons, which resembles materia from Final Fantasy
VII, but in practice works differently.

There are no random battles in *Trails in the Sky*.  Rather, the enemies roam
the map freely.  They can be outmanoeuvred and attacked from behind for an
in-battle advantage and experience bonus, or entirely avoided if one does not
wish to fight.  The overall difficulty of the game is not high, except maybe for
some optional monsters and two or three boss fights.

Unlike most older JRPGs, *Trails in the Sky* does not have an overworld map.
You can only travel linearly through the world by using roads connecting cities
and villages.  This is something that I really dislike, because the world just
feels like a big corridor.  There is no fast travel; backtracking to earlier
locations is insufferable, and I just never bothered to do it, beyond what the
plot required from me.  Luckily, it requires barely any.

One thing that I was completely unprepared for in *Trails in the Sky* were the
lengthy dialogues and cutscenes.  I have mostly played 16-bit (SNES) and early
32-bit (PSX) JRPGs, where technical limitations forced the dialogues to be short
but succinct.  These technical limitations are no more, and writers of *Trails
in the Sky* made full use of it.  As a result, a series of dialogues can easily
last 15 minutes or even more, which is not far away from watching an anime
episode.  Because of these lengthy dialogues and a slowly developing plot, I
have stalled during my first playthrough back in 2023, after playing for about
17 hours.  Combined with a slowly-developing plot, it felt like I am spending a
lot of time with the game, but not really getting anywhere, so I just stopped
playing.  In the first half of 2024 I picked up where I left off a year before,
this time being fully prepared for the slow pace of the game, and played it to
completion.  Once I set my expectations right, the game was indeed a joy to
play.  In particular, I really began to enjoy the dialogues.  They flesh out the
characters in more detail than any other JRPG I have played up to this point
&mdash; except maybe for *Persona* games &mdash; which is important to make the
numerous characters feel unique and authentic.  What is interesting from a
gameplay perspective, Estelle and Joshua are the only two permanent playable
characters.  Many other playable characters join you at various points in the
plot, but they depart when the events dictate so.  This is something that adds a
lot of authenticity to the story.

In the end, it took me a total of 55 hours to finish the First Chapter, although
this time was spread out over approximately 1.5 years.  *Trails in the Sky* is
light on mechanics and difficulty, but offers a world and characters fleshed out
in great detail.  The pace of the story is quite slow, which initially was an
obstacle for me.  But once I set my expectations right, I really enjoyed my time
with the game.  I hope to play the *Second Chapter* eventually, although other
JRPG titles have been occupying my time recently.

[^1]: The "FC" suffix stands for *First Chapter* and is sometimes omitted.  The
      second game is known as *Trails in the Sky SC* &mdash; SC standing for the
      *Second Chapter* &mdash; or *Trails in the Sky 2nd*.

[^2]: A friend, who played on PC, told me there are also reverse patches that
      apply changes from the Evolution version on Vita to the PC release.
