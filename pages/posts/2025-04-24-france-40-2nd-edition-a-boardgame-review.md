France '40, 2nd Edition. A boardgame review
===========================================

Towards the end of 2023 [I reviewed a boardgame called Salerno
'43](https://jstolarek.github.io/posts/2023-10-25-salerno-43.html) and mentioned
my return to wargaming.  Since then, I have been actively playing wargames
&mdash; though maybe not as frequently as I would hope for &mdash; and have also
purchased a few new games.  The one I want to write about today is [the second
edition of France '40 from GMT
Games](https://www.gmtgames.com/p-635-france-40-2nd-edition.aspx), which came
out in 2024.  I already had the first edition, released in 2013, but this new
release revises the units and the rules.  It also offers better quality of
components: thicker counters, sturdier box, and, optionally, a mounted map
&mdash; like many other wargames, France '40 comes with paper maps by default.
Knowing how good the game is, upgrade to the second edition was an obvious
choice.

Similarly to Salerno '43 and other WWII games by Mark Simonitch, France '40 is a
hex-and-counter game for two players.  It focuses on the German invasion of
France in May and June 1940.  The game comes with two scenarios, each with its
own separate map, and a campaign game that combines both scenarios into one
game.  First is the Sickle Cut scenario, which depicts the German advance
towards the English Channel in May 1940.  Germans start at the eastern edge of
the map, near the town of Namur and in the Ardennes forest south of it, and must
advance towards the English Channel and the coastal town of Abbeville in the
west.  The Allied player, commanding combined France and British forces, plays a
defensive game and must attempt to stop, or at least slow down, the German
offensive.

The second scenario, called Dynamo, takes place in late May and early June and
depicts the Allied evacuation from Dunkirk.  The Allies are tasked with
evacuating their troops, which requires conducting an organized retreat that
slows down the German advance towards the coast.  This scenario also involves
Belgian troops fighting on the Allied side, though they surrender on 28 May.

Every scenario can play out in many different ways.  Sometimes, a game will
result in historical outcomes.  Other times, it will be a complete opposite of
what happened.  I have played a Sickle Cut game, where the German player's plan
to advance through the Ardennes completely failed.  As a result, the entire
German offensive was stopped, with barely any progress made towards the English
Channel.

Rule complexity of France '40 is comparable with other WWII games by Mark
Simonitch.  Even though each scenario comes with its unique rules &mdash;
e.g. train movement in Sickle Cut or beach evacuation in Dynamo &mdash; the
overall amount of special rules isn't large, and they don't add much complexity.
But most importantly, the overwhelming majority of terrain on both maps is
either a clear terrain or a forest, making it very easy to memorize terrain
properties and allowing to avoid frequent checking of Terrain Effect Chart.  As
a result, the game plays quickly &mdash; by wargaming standards at least.  Once
both players know the rules, the Dynamo scenario can be played in about 3 hours,
while Sickle Cut takes about 4 hours.

For these precise reasons, out of all games by Mark Simonitch, this is the one
that makes it to my table most often.  The short playing time makes it easy to
play the game multiple times and experiment with different strategies.  I in
particular enjoy playing Dynamo scenario as the Allied, where blocking the
German advance feels like a puzzle to solve.  A puzzle that is different every
time, because the opponent never makes the same decisions.

GMT Games needs help because of the tariffs
-------------------------------------------

Unfortunately, the timing of this post is not accidental.  If you follow the
news, then you are aware of recent tariffs introduced by Donald Trump on goods
imported from China.  With the situation changing daily it is hard to tell how
this is going to end, but in their current form these tariffs are an existential
threat to many American game publishers, including GMT Games.  There is [a good
post on
BoardGameGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/blog/1/blogpost/172959/tariff-talk-from-stonemaier-cephalofair-game-trayz)
that compiles explanations from various publishers on why it is not possible to
move production from China to the USA.  [The latest customer update from GMT
Games](https://mailchi.mp/2438d2843c59/april-17-update-from-gmt-tariffs-and-action-plan-new-p500s-updated-production-outlook-designer-updates-and-more)
goes into more details on the current financial situation &mdash; a highly
recommended read.  The gist is that we can help GMT Games and other publishers
to weather this storm by purchasing games directly from them, allowing to
maintain financial fluidity in the coming weeks.
