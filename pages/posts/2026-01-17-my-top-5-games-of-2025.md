My Top 5 games of 2025
======================

In 2025, I managed to spend quite a substantial amount of time on gaming.  I had
an ambitious plan of writing longer reviews of games that I finish.  That didn't
work out as intended and the only game I reviewed in 2025 was [_The Legend of
Heroes: Trails in the Sky
FC_](2025-04-19-the-legend-of-heroes-trails-in-the-sky-fc-game-review.html).
This post is an attempt to make up for it.  Here's a list of my top 5 games
finished this year, with a brief overview of each one.  Games are listed in the
order of playing.

Breath of Fire IV
-----------------

_Breath of Fire is_ a series of JRPGs that was somewhat popular in the 90s
(first instalment released on SNES in 1993) and early 2000s (fifth instalment on
PS2 in 2003)[^1].  _Breath of Fire IV_ was released for the first PlayStation in
2000[^2].  This was late in the console's life cycle.  As a result the game is
well polished when it comes to technical aspects and stands out in terms of
graphics.  It features large, well animated and detailed 2D sprites, seamlessly
combined with 3D environments.  And while these environments can be rotated,
they still look like they were 2D pixel art.

To me, the most important aspect of _Breath of Fire IV_ is its cinematic
storytelling, with a unique approach of presenting the plot both from the
perspective of the main protagonist (Ryu) as well as the antagonist (Fou-Lu) -
the game regularly switches between the two, until their paths finally converge
towards the end of the game.  Perhaps it isn't as impressive by today's
standards, but it certainly was a standout 25 years ago.

If I were to point out any downsides, it would be the fights.  These occur
randomly, though not very frequently.  I mean, not very frequently by 90s JRPG
standards.  Fights are turn-based.  First, you select attacks for three of your
characters; you can swap between characters in the front and back row, somewhat
similar to what _Final Fantasy X_ would offer a year later.  Once you commit to
actions for the given turn, attacks play out according to initiative.  At this
point you basically just watch a series of attack animations.  Despite nice
visuals, this gets boring.

Another thing I didn't exactly like is the fact that Ryu is a _silent
protagonist_, i.e. he does not speak a single world throughout the game.  The
rationale behind the silent protagonist trope is that the protagonist is an
avatar of the player; rather than having game creators insert words into the
player's mouth, the player can insert their own thoughts instead.  This is not
an uncommon plot device in JRPGs - other titles such as the _Persona_ series,
_Chrono Trigger_ or _Fire Emblem Awakening_ immediately come to mind - but I
have never found this rationale to be convincing.  Rather than increasing
immersion - which, I believe, is the ultimate goal here - it creates a main
character that is an empty, unmemorable, and uninspired vessel.  This does not
mean that the game with a silent protagonist has to be bad, though.  I mean,
_Chrono Trigger_ and _Persona_ are consider among the best JRPGs ever made,
despite having a silent protagonist, and _Breath of Fire IV_ is also very good.
It's just that nobody is going to remember the game for its protagonist.

Persona 5 Royal
---------------

I was planning to write a long, separate post on _Persona 5 Royal_ (P5R), but
that is less and less likely to happen.  This short recap will have to suffice,
at least for now.

I first started playing _Persona 5 Royal_ in late 2023.  After playing for about
17 hours or so, I lost momentum and put down the game for a couple of weeks.  I
resumed playing around March 2024 and my playthrough was going smoothly until I
ran into problems with Proton, which just [stopped working on my Linux
machine](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton/issues/7894).  Despite being
fairly knowledgeable with Linux and Wine, after weeks of debugging I had to
admit defeat.  This is the exact kind of problem I highlighted in [my critique
of Proton from late
2023](posts/2023-11-27-proton-is-detrimental-to-linux-as-a-gaming-platform.html):

> A lot of games do not run well, or at all, with Proton.  Moreover, even if a
> game runs fine on the release, there is absolutely no guarantee that it will
> stay this way.  In the past, there have been many situations when changes
> introduced in a game patch or Proton broke a game.

I have then put down the game for nearly a year, and only resumed playing in
early 2025, when I decided to bite the bullet and boot into Windows to play.

_Persona 4 Golden_ (P4G) is one of the best JRPGs I have ever played and it set
the bar high for _Persona 5 Royal_.  In some aspects, P5R is an improvement; in
some, it is not.  The gameplay definitely feels better, thanks to the addition
of a whole bunch of new combat mechanics that make dungeon crawling a lot more
fun.  Also, unlike in P4G, the dungeons are no longer randomly generated.  Where
P5R falls short in my opinion, is its plot.  The initial third of the game,
roughly 40 hours or so, just feels kinda _meh_.  (And yes, you read that right -
the game takes around 120h to complete.)  The plot seems a bit forced, without a
clear goal, and even characters themselves admit they don't know what to do.
Only later in the game, things start to converge and make more sense, and the
resolution of the plot feels satisfying.

</div>

I have one major complaint about the _Persona 5 Royal_.  The game spans over the
course of three schools semesters.  The first two semesters you experience
day-by-day, spending mornings in school and afternoons on free activities.  In
the original _Persona 5_ released in 2016, the third semester has a handful of
scripted events and most of the days are skipped.  The _Royal_ version released
in 2019, expands on the third semester, adding a whole plot arc, a new dungeon,
and new characters, whose plot arcs are fully resolved during that third
semester.  However, to access this new version of the third semester you must
spend your time with Maruki, the school counsellor, and max out your social link
with him.  The game doesn't say this explicitly though.  Since Maruki was not
among my favourite characters, I didn't really spend time with him and only
learned that **I've been locked out of the third semester after playing the game
for over 90 hours**.  I don't think any game has ever made me feel that angry
and disappointed.  I always thought that _Persona_ games are great examples of
being beginner-friendly, not allowing the players to play themselves into a
corner or do something really stupid.  But the Maruki thing is one huge
exception to that.  I ended up downloading save files from the Internet.  This
allowed me to experience the plot first-hand, rather than watching a playthrough
on YouTube, but not being able to play with characters that I have built was
nevertheless a huge disappointment.  Online search quickly reveals that I am not
the only person who experienced the same problem.  But despite the third
semester issue and the initial plot not being well-motivated, I still consider
_Persona 5 Royal_ as one of the best JRPGs I have ever played.

Final Fantasy VII Rebirth
-------------------------

For many Western players, myself included, _Final Fantasy VII_ was the first
JRPG they have ever played.  A recent remake of this cult classic has been
controversial since it makes departures from the original, possibly the biggest
of which is splitting the original story into three consecutive games.
_Rebirth_ is the second, and latest, instalment in the trilogy.

Having read the reviews first, I approached _Final Fantasy VII Rebirth_ with a
certain caution.  A consistent complaint about _Rebirth_ was the amount of
mini-games the player has to participate in.  Gameplay bloat was already a
problem for me in the _Final Fantasy VII Remake_, i.e. the first entry in the
new trilogy.  I mean, _Remake_ takes around 30h to complete if you just focus on
the main plot, and it corresponds to a 5-hour segment in the original game.
Obviously, a lot had to be added to make the game longer.  This was my main
gripe with the _Remake_.

<div class="thumbnail">

</figure>

</div>

With _Rebirth_, I wanted to focus on the story, just like I did in the _Remake_,
so I ignored most of the activities and side quest in the open world, as these
tend to be very generic and uninspired.  That being said, the world is beautiful
and wandering without a purpose on a chocobo is fun, albeit not very rewarding.

</figure>
<figcaption>This is the most realistic cinematic I have seen to date.</figcaption>
</div>

One thing I need to point out about _Remake_ and _Rebirth_ is that I really
don't like the new real time combat system.  I really appreciate turn-based RPGs
and how they force the player to think and plan strategically.  In a real-time
system this planning is gone and replaced by hectic button-mashing.  In
particular, the remakes have the player control in real-time three (!)
characters.  The end result is total chaos; I found the combat system
overwhelming and simply not fun.  The nail in the coffin is how camera works, or
rather: how it doesn't work.  Combats often look like this:

</figure>
<figcaption>Good luck making sense out of this mess.</figcaption>
</div>

My solution was to set the game difficulty to easy in order to minimize the
amount of time spent in combat.  That made the game a lot more enjoyable.

Last, but not least - the plot.  As already mentioned, _Rebirth_ makes
departures from the original.  I am totally fine with that.  Telling the exact
same story twice wouldn't be much fun for me.  I appreciate changes and
additions, except maybe for this weird Roche guy.  Both remakes are certainly
slightly weirder than the original, as if it was trying to be a _Yakuza_ game,
but overall I am happy with the plot and the characters.

In the end, after making a conscious effort to avoid the game's shortcomings,
_Final Fantasy VII Rebirth_ turned out to be a lot of fun.

Unicorn Overlord
----------------

_Unicorn Overlord_ is one of a few recent games where, upon hearing the title
for the first time, you hope it is only a working title that will be changed for
the release.  As you can tell, it wasn't just a working title.  But anyway, in
this strategic JRPG you control prince Alain, the rightful heir to the throne
who returns from exile to take back his kingdom from an evil usurper.  If the
plot synopsis makes you think that the plot might not be the strongest part of
the game, you will be absolutely right.  Luckily, _Unicorn Overlord_ makes up
for it with exceptionally fun gameplay.

<div class="thumbnail">

</figure>
<figcaption>I really appreciate _Unicorn Overlord_ for its 2D art style.
Also, I really got to like Virginia.</figcaption>
</div>

The game consists of two core elements.  Firstly, fighting battles to liberate
new regions.  Battles happen in real-time, but there is an active pause.  In
_Unicorn Overlord_, units consist of up to five characters fighting in a single
formation.  You don't get to control individual characters during the battle;
instead battles play out automatically, with characters acting according to
preassigned tactics.  Tactics are ordered, conditional lists of attacks, such as
"if there are flying units in front row, attack them with skill X".  With over
60 characters and over 20 basic character classes (and further possibilities of
promoting to advanced classes), the task of figuring out which characters and
tactics result in good synergies is far from trivial.  Experimenting with
different builds, unit compositions, and tactics is fun, but also slightly
tiring at times.  While the game hints at which character classes are effective
when paired together, the number of available combinations quickly becomes
overwhelming.

</figure>
<figcaption>Fights between units can be skipped, but watching them play out
really helps in understanding and fine-tuning the tactics.</figcaption>
</div>

The second core element of gameplay is rebuilding reclaimed areas through
various world map activities, such as gathering resources and using them to
rebuild cities, or carrying out various smaller quests.

_Unicorn Overlord_ was much talked about on release due to its English
translation, which takes a lot of liberties w.r.t. the original.  Sadly, this
criticism feels justified.  Even worse, same concerns can be raised about the
majority of modern English translations from Japanese, _Final Fantasy VII
Rebirth_ being another "great" example.

Overall, I had lots of fun with this game.  While the plot isn't the most
memorable one, _Unicorn Overlord_'s gameplay feels like a massive improvement
over the _Fire Emblem_ series.

Pentiment
---------

Yet another game that I started playing 3 years ago, right after its release in
late 2022, and only finished in 2025.  I decided to discard several hours of
past playthrough and start over since I couldn't recall the plot details.

_Pentiment_ takes place in the early XVI century, shortly after the end of
Middle Ages and at the dawn of Renaissance.  Big societal changes of that period
paint a backdrop for the main plot, which focuses on the lives of ordinary
people in a fictional Bavarian town of Tassing.  Graphically, the game looks
like a 2D adventure of the 90s, but stylized to resemble Middle Ages paintings.
Under the hood though, this is really an RPG.  There is no combat or equipment
though.  It is the dialogues and choices that drive the game, with various
personal backgrounds and sets of skills available to the main protagonist,
Andreas, affecting what options are available to the player.  Perhaps the game
that comes closest in terms of gameplay would be _Disco Elysium_, though
_Pentiment_ does not have RPG-style checks.  Rather, whether you succeed on a
check or not depends solely on the choices you have made so far.

What I loved the most about _Pentiment_ is how it aims to accurately recreate
the daily lives of people in the early XVI century.  It shouldn't come as a
surprise that the director of the game, Josh Sawyer, is a historian by
education; he also happens to be the designer of major RPG hits, such as
_Icewind Dale_, _Neverwinter Nights 2_, _Fallout: New Vegas_ and _Pillars of
Eternity_.

_Pentiment_ is an extremely rare case, when I decided to play in Polish, which
brings me to one nitpick that I have about the game.  It is pretty evident that
the Polish localization was done solely from the script, since there are many
mistranslations resulting from the lack of dialogue context.

Notable mentions
----------------

I also have a few notable mentions; games that didn't qualify for my top 5, but
are still worth mentioning.

### Nier: Automata

Another game that I managed to complete this year after having started it a few
years ago.  I loved the artistic vision - character and world design, music, the
ever-present feeling of longing and solitude - but I found the gameplay lacking.

### Silksong

I had lots of fun playing Hollow Knight.  I am not having so much fun with the
sequel, Silksong, due to its difficulty and how unfair it is at times.  I spent
about 20 hours in the game and don't think I have enough skill to progress past
Act I of the game.  At this point, I have pretty much just given up on it.

### Dispatch

I am allergic to anything superhero-related.  As such, Dispatch comes as a
pleasant surprise, where the story about superheroes is essentially an office
comedy.  The game is very light on gameplay and focuses on narrative choices.

### Doki Doki Literature Club

I don't want to spoil this one, so let's just say this is a kawaii visual novel
with the exact kind of dark twist that I like.  Available for free [on
itch.io](https://teamsalvato.itch.io/ddlc), though I played the Switch version.

### Needy Girl Overdose

Another visual novel with dark twists.  This time you assume the role of a
manager for an online streamer, KAngel.  It's up to you whether she's gonna
spend her time gaming and streaming about nerd stuff, or taking drugs and
indulging in conspiracy theories.

Summary
-------

Having written this post, two things stand out.  Firstly, 2025 was a year of
JRPGs for me.  I finished several titles I started a few years back, but also
played a whole bunch of new ones.  Secondly, I played a lot - each of my top 5
titles requires dozens of hours - thanks mostly to handheld gaming.  Getting the
Nintendo Switch and the Steam Deck is what made the difference for me, but that
is a topic for another post.

[^1]: Sixth part of the game was released in 2016 as a free-to-play and was
      operational for about a year.  Let's pretend it didn't happen.

[^2]: As I was playing Breath of Fire IV on the original PlayStation, the PC
      port from 2003 [was released on
      GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv).
