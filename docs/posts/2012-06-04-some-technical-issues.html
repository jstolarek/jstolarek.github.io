<p>I’ve been reported that some people experience technical issues with my blog and
in fact I experienced them myself. The common problem is that sometimes a
particular post won’t load. Instead you get a RSS feed. Reloading the page
doesn’t help in any way. I don’t know what’s causing the issue, but it’s
certainly not browser-specific. Googling suggests that it might be problem with
hosting but I wasn’t able to pin the problem yet. The only solution that seems
to work is cleaning the cookies and then reloading the page (at least it worked
for me). If anyone has any suggestion regarding this I’ll be glad to hear them.</p>
<p>It also happened to me twice that I got a listing of directory on the server
instead of the actual web page. This is definitely issue on the server
side. Reloading the page solves the problem.</p>
