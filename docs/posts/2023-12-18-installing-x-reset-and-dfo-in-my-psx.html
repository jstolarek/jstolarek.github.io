<p>I recently wrote about <a href="2023-11-30-installing-a-gcloader-in-my-gamecube.html">installing a GCLoader in a GameCube I
own</a>, but on the same day
I also installed two additional mods in my PlayStation: an <a href="https://www.consolesunleashed.com/product/sony-playstation-x-reset-mod-kit/">X-Reset
mod</a>
and a <a href="https://www.consolesunleashed.com/product/sony-playstation-dual-frequency-oscillator-mod-kit/">DFO
mod</a>,
both purchased from <a href="https://www.consolesunleashed.com/">Consoles Unleashed</a>.</p>

<p>I already <a href="2023-03-35-installing-xstation.html">installed XStation in my PSX</a>,
which is an optical drive emulator (ODE) that allows launching games from ISO
images stored on an SD card. While it’s super convenient to have all games on a
single memory card, there was a minor usability issue related to using XStation.
Resetting the console to return to XStation’s game selection menu required
physically pushing button on the console. Not a big deal, but somewhat annoying
when you’re sitting on a couch and want to quickly test a bunch of games.
X-Reset fixes that by adding button combinations to the controller that allow to
reset both the game (back to the title screen) and the console (back to
XStation’s game selection menu). Installation of X-Reset requires soldering a
small QSB (quick solder board) to the bottom of the motherboard.</p>

<h2 id="dfo">DFO</h2>
<p>I have a PAL-region console, where the games were timed to run at 50Hz.
Obviously, playing at 60Hz results in smoother experience and a PAL PlayStation
with XStation installed can actually switch to displaying 60Hz signal when
running NTSC games<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. However, when a PAL console runs an NTSC game the GPU
timings are slightly incorrect, resulting in a refresh rate that’s off by around
1 percent. This is rather unnoticeable, but certain games will not work because
of that difference.</p>
<p>This can be fixed with a DFO mod. DFO stands for Dual Frequency Oscillator. As
the name suggests, it allows to automatically<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> supply different GPU timings
depending on the game region, thus ensuring that games run at correct speed both
in 50Hz and 60Hz.</p>
<p>Installing the mod is a bit tricky. As you can see from the photos below the
mod requires soldering four wires to the motherboard. That’s the simple part.
The difficult part is desoldering a resistor in order to disconnect the GPU from
the original frequency oscillator. That resistor is located under the RF shield
that covers top of the motherboard. The RF shield needs to be desoldered and
this was a difficult task. I was unable to fully desolder it and resorted to
lifting it as much as possible to remove the resistor. It worked, but I can’t
say I felt confident doing that.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Both mods required fairly simple soldering. I’ve certainly done more
complicated mods, but this time something went wrong and I really messed up the
solder joints. They hold, but they don’t turned out the way they should.
Either my soldering iron is giving out or I messed up when using rosin, which I
hadn’t used previously.</p>

<li id="fn1"><p>I am committing a crime here by equating PAL with 50Hz refresh rate and
NTSC with 60Hz refresh rate. There is a common misconception that PAL and
NTSC standards prescribe a particular refresh rate, but that is not the
case. Both PAL and NTSC are colour coding standards and nothing else.
They do not define refresh rates.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>I am very curious how that actually works. How does a simple mod
connected with only four cables recognize the game region?<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li>
