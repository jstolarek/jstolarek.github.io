<p>Computer science is what I do for the most of my time, but it is not the only
thing that occupies my time and thoughts. Below is a short list of my other
activities, interests and hobbies.</p>
<section id="retro-gaming" style="overflow: auto;">
<h2>Retro gaming</h2>
<p><img src="/images/handhelds.jpg" class="img-right" /></p>
<p>I am interested in the history of gaming. I enjoy playing retro games, both on
original hardware and using emulators. I own a humble collection of retro
consoles and handhelds.</p>
</section>
<section id="frank-herberts-dune" style="overflow: auto;">
<h2>Frank Herbert’s “Dune”</h2>
<p><img src="/images/fremenzone.png" class="img-left" /></p>
<p>I am a big fan of Frank Herbert’s “Dune” novel. I run <a href="https://www.fremenzone.pl">Fremen
Zone</a>, a Polish fansite with an over 25-year history,
dedicated to the works of Frank Herbert, as well as game and film adaptations of
“Dune”.</p>
</section>
<section id="mountain-trekking" style="overflow: auto;">
<h2>Mountain trekking</h2>
<p><img src="/images/mountain_trekking.jpg" class="img-right" /></p>
<p>I enjoy mountain trekking, especially multi-day trips to remote areas devoid of
people. I have been to various ranges of Carpathians in Poland, Slovakia,
Ukraine and Romania, as well as the Scottish Highlands.</p>
</section>
<section id="biking" style="overflow: auto;">
<h2>Biking</h2>
<p><img src="/images/biking.jpg" class="img-left" /></p>
<p>When not in the mountains, I enjoy biking in rural areas.</p>
</section>
<section id="history-and-wargaming" style="overflow: auto;">
<h2>History and wargaming</h2>
<p><img src="/images/wargaming.jpg" class="img-right" /></p>
<p>I see history as an important mean to understand modern world. I am especially
interested in the period of Second World War. Antony Beevor is one of my
favourite authors. I also like to play wargames, i.e. strategy board games that
aim at recreating historical conflicts to allow their better understanding and
provide entertainment at the same time.</p>
</section>
<section id="paper-models-and-aviation" style="overflow: auto;">
<h2>Paper models and aviation</h2>
<p><img src="/images/models.jpg" class="img-left" /></p>
<p>I usually spend autumn and winter evenings making paper models, a hobby my
father introduced me to when I was a kid. I have a keen interest in aviation so
most of my models are fighter airplanes from the World War II.</p>
</section>
<section id="evolutionary-biology" style="overflow: auto;">
<h2>Evolutionary biology</h2>
<p><img src="/images/ants.jpg" class="img-right" /></p>
<p>Since I am a computer scientist it might come as a surprise that works that
influenced me the most as a researcher were those by biologists: Richard
Dawkins, Charles Darwin and Edward O. Wilson. One field of biology that I am
particularly fond of is myrmecology, ie. research of ants. I even used to have
several ant colonies at home! I am also interested in philosophical work that
aims to explain phenomena of consciousness and morality through mechanisms of
evolution.</p>
